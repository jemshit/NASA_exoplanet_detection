## 🚀 Overview

**S'kaiNet — Exoplanet analyzer** is an AI-powered exoplanet detection system developed for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**.
Inspired by *Star Trek’s* Vulcan pursuit of knowledge — **“S'kai”**, meaning enlightenment — our project combines scientific curiosity with artificial intelligence to identify exoplanets from NASA’s open datasets.

Our mission: To build an intelligent platform that helps humanity discover new worlds — automatically.

## The Challenge

NASA’s exoplanet missions — **Kepler**, **K2**, and **TESS** — have collected massive datasets from their space surveys.
However, most exoplanet discoveries are still **identified manually** by scientists.

We aim to automate this process through a **machine learning model** trained on **NASA’s open-source datasets**.
The model predicts whether an observation corresponds to a **confirmed exoplanet**, **planetary candidate**, or **false positive** — based on parameters like:

- Orbital Period
- Transit Duration
- Planetary Radius
- Stellar Brightness

### 🌍 Our Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize datasets from `Kepler` missions.
2. **Model Training:** Build and tune ML models using `scikit-learn`.
3. **Interactive UI:** Develop a web interface for real-time prediction and data uploads.
4. **Continuous Learning:** Allow users to retrain models dynamically with new data.

## 🎬 The Exoplanet Enigma — Fictional Story Adaptation

Our team, **Outlander**, reimagined our NASA Space Apps Challenge project —
***A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI*** — as a cinematic *Star Trek*-inspired short screenplay titled ***The Exoplanet Enigma***.

In this fictional story, the crew of the **USS Enterprise-D**, led by **Captain Kirk**, **Spock**, and **Number One**, venture into a mysterious nebula and discover a gravitational anomaly resembling a planet. Unable to rely on visual assumptions, Spock deploys our AI-powered detection system **S’kaiNet - Exoplanet analyzer**, a scientific interface developed by **Starfleet’s Outlander Team**. Using real mission data from **Kepler**, the system calculates a 87 % probability that the object is a confirmed **exoplanet**.
Through this blend of **science fiction storytelling** and **real astrophysical methodology**, *The Exoplanet Enigma* mirrors the same logic and data-driven exploration principles behind our actual NASA project.

🎧 The story was also adapted into an **audio fiction podcast** titled ***S’kaiNet Chronicles***, combining cinematic voice acting, immersive sound design, and AI-generated narration to bring the Starfleet discovery to life.

---

### 🧠 Behind the Scenes

The screenplay and podcast were built directly upon our hackathon prototype.

* The fictional **S’kaiNet - Exoplanet analyzer** system mirrors the architecture of our real-world AI model, which analyzes exoplanetary transit data to detect potential new worlds.
* We used **OpenAI, Google Gemini, NotebookLM tools**, **Python**, and **machine-learning pipelines** integrated with NASA’s **exoplanet archives** to train and test the model.
* The **screenplay** was written in *Fountain* format and professionally styled to standard Hollywood formatting, while the **podcast** was produced from the same script using AI-assisted audio synthesis and human-directed editing.

This creative adaptation demonstrates how data science, storytelling, and imagination can converge to make complex scientific concepts both **accessible** and **inspiring**.
