## 🚀 Overview

**S'kaiNet** is an AI-powered exoplanet detection system developed for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**.
Inspired by *Star Trek’s* Vulcan pursuit of knowledge — **“S'kai”**, meaning enlightenment — our project combines scientific curiosity with artificial intelligence to identify exoplanets from NASA’s open datasets.

Our mission:
> To build an intelligent platform that helps humanity discover new worlds — automatically.

---

## 🧠 The Challenge

NASA’s exoplanet missions — **Kepler**, **K2**, and **TESS** — have collected massive datasets from their space surveys.
However, most exoplanet discoveries are still **identified manually** by scientists.

We aim to automate this process through a **machine learning model** trained on **NASA’s open-source datasets**.
The model predicts whether an observation corresponds to a **confirmed exoplanet**, **planetary candidate**, or **false positive** — based on parameters like:

- Orbital Period
- Transit Duration
- Planetary Radius
- Stellar Brightness

### 🌍 Our Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize datasets from Kepler, K2, and TESS missions.
2. **Model Training:** Build and tune ML models using `scikit-learn`.
3. **Interactive UI:** Develop a web interface for real-time prediction and data uploads.
4. **Continuous Learning:** Allow users to retrain models dynamically with new data.
